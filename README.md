  ABSTRACT
  Drunk driving, a global concern, contributes significantly to road accidents, injuries, 
  and fatalities. This project presents the development of an engine locking system 
  integrated with an alcohol detection sensor, aiming to deter drunk driving and 
  improve road safety. By detecting driver intoxication exceeding a pre-determined 
  threshold, the system utilizes an engine immobilization mechanism to prevent 
  vehicle startup. Additionally, visual and audible alerts are implemented for 
  warnings, and data logging capabilities capture detection events. The project 
  involves selecting and integrating hardware components like the sensor, 
  microcontroller, and immobilization mechanism, alongside software development 
  for data acquisition, analysis, and control logic. While the successful project 
  contributes to potential road safety improvements, ethical considerations and legal 
  implications surrounding such technologies require further research and responsible 
  implementation.

  INTRODUCTION
  Drunk driving, a global threat: Globally, drunk driving remains a significant 
  concern, responsible for countless accidents, injuries, and fatalities. This project 
  addresses this critical issue.
  Introducing the Alcohol-Interlock Engine Locking System: We present an alcoholbased engine locking system, a novel technology designed to deter drunk driving 
  and actively contribute to safer roads.
  Functionality: The system integrates an advanced alcohol detection sensor with an 
  engine immobilization mechanism. If the detected BAC exceeds a pre-set threshold, 
  the system immediately immobilizes the engine, preventing vehicle startup. This 
  decisive action discourages driving under the influence.
  Beyond Immobilization: Recognizing the importance of clear communication, the 
  system incorporates visual and audible alerts. Additionally, data logging capabilities 
  record alcohol detection events for further analysis.
  Ethical Considerations and a Responsible Approach: While celebrating the potential 
  of this technology, the project acknowledges the crucial need for ethical 
  considerations and responsible implementation. Careful examination of potential 
  legal implications and adherence to established regulations are crucial.
