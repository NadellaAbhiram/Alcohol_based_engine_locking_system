Drunk driving, a global concern, contributes significantly to road accidents, injuries, 
and fatalities. This project presents the development of an engine locking system 
integrated with an alcohol detection sensor, aiming to deter drunk driving and 
improve road safety. By detecting driver intoxication exceeding a pre-determined 
threshold, the system utilizes an engine immobilization mechanism to prevent 
vehicle startup. Additionally, visual and audible alerts are implemented for 
warnings, and data logging capabilities capture detection events. The project 
involves selecting and integrating hardware components like the sensor, 
microcontroller, and immobilization mechanism, alongside software development 
for data acquisition, analysis, and control logic. While the successful project 
contributes to potential road safety improvements, ethical considerations and legal 
implications surrounding such technologies require further research and responsible 
implementation
